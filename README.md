## 🧩 Backend / API

Worm-AI uses a **reverse-engineered Grok API wrapper** originally developed here:

> [https://github.com/realasfngl/Grok-Api](https://github.com/realasfngl/Grok-Api)

This wrapper acts as a proxy-like interface, allowing the CLI to access Grok endpoints **without official API credentials**.
